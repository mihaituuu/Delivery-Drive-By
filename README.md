# Delivery-Drive-By
Very small indie game, regarding customer service, especially delivery services.

It's a small Unity project, done in around 2 hours, messing around with Unity tools and C#.
The target of the game is just to deliver a few packages marked as RED SQUARES to the customer marked as a BLUE TRIANGLE.
The car changes it's color regarding if you have a package or not.
While playing you can find YELLOW CIRCLES, meaning that's the Speed Boost.
You can bump into houses, trees, and that's a not good thing, you'll slow down :)
Enjoy, maybe I'll work more on this game. 
Many thanks!
